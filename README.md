The game is similar to candy crush. The agent looks ahead 10 moves forward and makes a decision.
Used multiple hashing methods and alpha beta pruning with ordering to improve agent's speed.

Input format: 

<n> -- dimension of the board
<p> -- number of fruit types

Example:
//put it in input.txt
2
3
123.6
